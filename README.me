The project is not audited, and should never be used in a production setting

This is the server code for Alice looking for Bob. I wanted to have this run on an external server,
but i was unable to get the sandbox up and running on heroku. 

Steps to get the server up and running locally:

git clone https://github.com/freddyblockchain/dao-project.git

sandbox/./sandbox up testnet

npm install

npm start
