**The project is not audited, and should never be used in a production setting**

This is the server code for Alice looking for Bob. I wanted to have this run on an external server,
but i was unable to get the sandbox up and running on heroku. 

## Setup Guide:

start the algorand sandbox with : sudo sandbox/./sandbox up testnet

git clone https://github.com/freddyblockchain/dao-project.git --recursive

cd dao-project

npm install

npm start
